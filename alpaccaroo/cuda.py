"""Alpaccaroo's GPU tier: Python-source CUDA kernels, optionally JIT-compiled.

Weight matrices stay quantized in VRAM in the same universal codes layout
the NumPy backend unpacks (int8 codes + per-sub-block effective float32
scales/offsets, :func:`alpaccaroo.quants.np_unpack`). Every kernel here is
Alpaccaroo's own algorithm, authored in this file as ordinary Python and
compiled at runtime by the OPTIONAL, PINNED numba-cuda JIT
(``pip install alpaccaroo[gpu]``). Without a CUDA device or the pinned JIT -
or with ``ALPACCAROO_GPU=0`` - nothing changes: the CPU tiers (kernels/NumPy/
pure) remain the reference implementations and the fallback, and any error
in this tier degrades to them rather than failing the engine.

Placement: weight matrices move to VRAM at load, and only whole matrices -
per-matrix dispatch makes mixed GPU/CPU placement exact, so running out of
VRAM mid-load just leaves the rest on the CPU tiers. The host KV cache
stays authoritative (prefill's prefix reuse and truncation are untouched).
On top of the v1 per-matvec/GEMM dispatch this file adds two stage-2
paths; both degrade to the exact v1/CPU behavior on any failure:

- attention_batch: prefill's batched causal GQA - the O(n^2) share that
  made long prompts degrade with length - runs on the device with an
  online softmax. The per-layer K/V slice re-uploads from the host cache
  every chunk (measured tax in the wrapper docstring), far cheaper than
  the einsum it replaces.
- chain_forward: when EVERY chain matrix of a llama-class model is
  resident, whole-token decode runs device-side (rmsnorm, rope, GQA over
  a device K/V mirror, silu*up, residual adds) with ONE synchronization -
  the logits download - per token, instead of a sync D2H per matvec. The
  mirror uploads once after prefill; each decoded token's new K/V row is
  written on the device and copied back inside the same sync, so the host
  cache remains the source of truth, and Model._chain_invalidate re-syncs
  exactly the rows any host path rewrites.
- chain_prefill: whole prefill chunks on the same chain. The per-chunk
  host glue the stage-2 paths still paid - numpy batch rope, rmsnorm,
  residual adds, and an H2D/D2H ping-pong around every GEMM and the
  attention (measured 10.6 s of the 8B's 17.6 s 4096-token prefill) -
  moves into batch kernels chained device-side: one embedding upload per
  chunk, K/V rows written straight into the decode mirror (which the
  batched attention then READS, retiring the re-upload tax above), and
  one synchronous copy-back of the chunk's K/V rows to the authoritative
  host cache. Same gate, same fallback: any failure recomputes the chunk
  on the exact existing path.

The token embedding never uploads: it is a row-gather workload, the one
shape these kernels are wrong for, and it must stay gatherable on the host.

Pin policy: numba-cuda is locked to ``NUMBA_CUDA_PIN`` below, mirroring
the kernels tier. The pin is never updated implicitly; a different
installed version deactivates the tier (``ALPACCAROO_GPU=force`` overrides at
your own risk).

Known trap, recorded because the failure is silent and misattributed: with
``nvidia-nvjitlink`` missing, cuda.core's DLL search can find a torch
wheel's bundled nvJitLink_120_0.dll instead, and every kernel then dies
with nvJitLinkError ERROR_OUTDATED_LIBRARY(14). The availability probe
below therefore compiles and RUNS a real kernel, catches Exception
broadly, and reports the cause through status() instead of activating a
tier that cannot launch.

Buffer reuse contract: the per-size pinned/device activation buffers (and
the grow-only batched-matmul staging pair) are not synchronized for
concurrent callers - alpaccaroo's own server serializes generation behind a
lock, same caveat as the hot-weight cache in :mod:`alpaccaroo.qmatrix`.
Every matvec and every batched matmul ends with a synchronous D2H on the
legacy default stream, which drains the queued async H2D and kernel, so
rewriting the staging buffers on the next call is safe.

    matvecs, rope + K/V-mirror row store, GQA attention over the mirror,
    the residual-fused output/down projections and silu*up - one queued
    launch each, ONE synchronization per token. The host KV cache stays
    authoritative: the token's new K/V rows are async-copied back inside
    that same sync, and every host mutation path (prefill's batch writes,
    truncation, reset, CPU decode) reports through Model._chain_invalidate
    so the mirror re-uploads exactly the rows the host changed before the
    next chained token.

    Built lazily on the first device-resident forward - the first
    PREFILL chunk when chain_prefill runs, the first decoded token
    otherwise (mirror allocation + upload); construction raises
    _ChainUnsupported for anything it cannot serve bit-for-bit honestly

    for that model instance. A TIED output head is not a refusal: the
    final hidden vector downloads (that D2H is the one sync) and the
    host computes the logits, since the tied embedding never uploads.
    ANY runtime failure also parks the chain; the token that failed is
    recomputed by the unchanged per-matvec path.

    The same instance serves prefill_chunk, the device-resident prefill
    path: whole chunks run through the batch kernels with the chunk's
    K/V rows written straight into this mirror (and copied back to the
    authoritative host cache), so the batched attention reads the
    mirror instead of re-uploading host K/V every chunk and the first
