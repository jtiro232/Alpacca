"""Measure this machine instead of assuming it.

No single thread count is best everywhere. Physical cores is a good default
for a bandwidth-bound decode loop, but a machine with more memory channels
than cores, an SMT design that hides latency well, or a small matrix whose
work does not repay a thread-pool wake-up, all disagree with it - and they
disagree in different directions.

So: run a **bounded** warm micro-benchmark over a handful of thread counts,
on the shapes the model actually dispatches, and cache the winner. The
rules the plan sets, kept literally:

* opt-in. Nothing here runs unless ``alpaccaroo tune`` is invoked or
  ``ALPACCAROO_AUTOTUNE=1`` is set. A normal CLI start never benchmarks.
* ``ALPACCAROO_THREADS`` always wins. A user who chose a number keeps it.
* the cache is keyed on everything that can change the answer - CPU,
  core counts, OS, Python/NumPy/Numba/llvmlite versions, the kernel
  module's own source - so an upgrade invalidates it rather than serving a
  stale winner.
* the probe is bounded: a fixed repetition count over synthetic matrices
  sized like the model's, with a wall-clock ceiling.

The probe matrices are synthesised from deterministic bytes, so tuning
needs no model file and touches no weights the user cares about; what
matters for a bandwidth-bound kernel is the shape and the dtype, not the
values.
