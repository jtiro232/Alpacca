"""Host-OS shims for two things POSIX hands us for free.

The engine asks for a capability; this module supplies the best available
implementation and returns a neutral answer when the host has none. Every
OS-specific line in Alpacca lives here, so `gguf.py` and `kernels.py` stay
platform-free and read the same everywhere.

In both functions the POSIX path comes first and returns immediately, so
Linux behaviour is exactly what it was before this module existed: the
fallbacks below it are only ever reached on hosts that lack the syscall.
